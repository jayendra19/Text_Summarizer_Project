# Text_Summarizer_Project

## the library being used in this project what they do and why?

Transformers: This library by Hugging Face provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like text classification, language generation, question answering, etc. It simplifies using and fine-tuning these models.

Datasets: Also from Hugging Face, it offers a wide range of datasets for NLP tasks, making it easy to access and use them for training and evaluation.

SacreBLEU: SacreBLEU is used for computing the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, which is a metric for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text.

Rouge Score: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a package that computes the ROUGE metric used in evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation.

Py7zr: Py7zr is a Python library for working with 7z (7-Zip) archives. It allows handling and extraction of 7z-compressed files.

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, providing data structures like DataFrames, essential for data handling and manipulation.

NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit is a comprehensive library for text processing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, parsing, and more.

TQDM: TQDM is a handy library for adding progress bars to Python code, making it easy to visualize the progress of tasks like loops and iterations.

PyYAML: PyYAML is used for working with YAML files, a human-readable data serialization format. It's often used for configuration files.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: These are Python libraries for creating data visualizations and plots, offering various types of plots for data analysis.

Torch: PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks. It provides support for tensor computations and automatic differentiation.

Notebook: The notebook library provides the Jupyter Notebook interface within Python environments, enabling interactive computing and data visualization.

Boto3 and mypy-boto3-s3: Boto3 is an AWS SDK for Python, enabling interaction with AWS services. mypy-boto3-s3 provides type annotations for the S3 service of AWS.

FastAPI and Uvicorn: These are used for building and running web APIs in Python. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework, and Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server.

Jinja2: Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python used in web development to generate dynamic content.

Ensure and Python-box: These might refer to specific versions or packages, but without specific information, it's challenging to provide details about their purpose.
